# ALSplitView - an autolayout based NSSplitView replacement

This custom view requires autolayout enabled in a xib it is added to. Note that autolayout is available since OS X 10.7 and not supported on 10.6 or older.

NSSplitView is a buggy thing when it comes to autolayout, so I've decided to write my own split view based on autolayout features. This repo contains also a demo project, which show a typical ALSplitView use cases.
